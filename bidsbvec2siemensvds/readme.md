# bidsvec2siemensdvs

This is a MATLAB function that will take a BIDS-style bvec file and convert it to 
a Siemens DVS file. This is useful if you need to duplicate a scan from a different 
site and you don't have the associated DVS file.

Test bvec files are provided to ensure correct functioning.
