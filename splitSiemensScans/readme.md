# splitSiemensScans

This is a MATLAB function that will take an unstructured 9flat) directory full
of DICOMs from a signle scan session, and organize them into subdirectories
named by the scan description.

This is useful if you happend to export the DICOMs using options that resulted
in a flat file structre, rather than one that has the scans separated.
