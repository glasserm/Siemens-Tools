# movementtracker

This is a MATLAB function that will read in a directory of Siemens
mosaic-formatted functional DICOMs, coregister them (using a mutual 
information alogrithm) all to the first time point, and report the 
angular transformation coefficients in graphical form.

This is useful if you'd like to see how much a human research subject
moved during a scan.
